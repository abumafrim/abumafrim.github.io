I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pretoria's Data Science for Social Impact Research Group, working on improving Natural Language Processing (NLP) for underrepresented African languages. I hold a PhD from Bayero University Kano, where I focused on using domain awareness, quality estimation, and transfer learning to optimize approaches for leveraging monolingual data to enhance machine translation in low-resource languages.

I have led and contributed to a range of impactful projects, including developing NLP resources and techniques for tasks such as LLM building, sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, semantic relatedness, hate and offensive speech analysis, machine translation, named-entity recognition, and sentence alignment. I actively collaborate with international research communities such as [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io/), [HausaNLP](https://github.com/hausanlp), [LITHME](https://lithme.eu/), and the [Open Language Data Initiative](https://oldi.org/), and have contributed to several Semantic Evaluation shared tasks: [AfriSenti 2023](https://afrisenti-semeval.github.io/), [SemRel 2024](https://github.com/semantic-textual-relatedness/Semantic_Relatedness_SemEval2024), and [BRIGHTER 2025](https://github.com/emotion-analysis-project/SemEval2025-Task11).

Iâ€™m passionate about mentoring students and early-career researchers, and I strive to integrate ethical, human-centric approaches into my work, aligning with my commitment to advancing NLP for social good. My research is driven by the belief that AI should be inclusive and accessible, and I aim to make meaningful contributions to the field while addressing the needs of underrepresented communities.
