My name is Idris Abdulmumin, a Postdoctoral Fellow of the [Data Science for Social Impact Research Group](https://dsfsi.github.io/) at the University of Pretoria, under the supervision of Professor Vukosi Marivate. I am also a lecturer at the Department of Computer Science, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.

I obtained my PhD in August 2023 under the supervision of Professor Bashir Shehu Galadanci at Bayero University Kano, marking a significant milestone in my academic journey. My doctoral research focused on enhancing machine translation systems for low resource languages by harnessing the power of monolingual data. This endeavor not only allowed me to delve deep into the intricacies of Natural Language Processing (NLP) but also sparked my passion for bridging language barriers through technology.

Throughout my doctoral, and postdoctoral, years, I had the privilege of collaborating extensively with fellow researchers in the field. My involvement with organizations like Masakhane, HausaNLP, and LITHME expanded my horizons and provided valuable insights into the global NLP community. These collaborations enriched my knowledge and fostered a spirit of innovation that continues to drive my research. 

I have led impactful projects, including MasaKhane's submission to WMT22 and managing the Lacuna 2022 grant for "AfriHate," a hate speech dataset for African languages. With roles in organising AfriSenti-SemEval 2023 and SemRel-SemEval 2024, curating datasets like Hausa Visual Genome, Hausa Visual Question Answering, LAFAND-MT and MasaKhaNER 2.0, and leading initiatives like HauWE, I am dedicated to advancing NLP for African languages.

As a postdoctoral fellow, I am excited to embark on a new challenge: developing resource-efficient language models, especially for African languages. As the continent is progressing towards developing inclusive datasets for several NLP research and applications, I am keen to contribute towards the development of language models that are not only efficient but also accessible to the African community.
